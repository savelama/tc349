       One of the websites that I access regularly on a mobile device is Facebook (http://m.facebook.com/).  I thought it was nice that they allowed you to log in using either a phone number or an e-mail address. In order to make their page mobile friendly and responsive, it seems like they’ve streamlined their content. The main page contains the content feed with posts from your friends, which seems to be exactly like the full-site without nearly as many images. I found it useful that they had site navigation links at both the top and bottom of the page, making it convenient to go from page to page without having to scroll all the way to the top every time.  
       
       The site looks functions great on mobile devices. I haven’t had an issue using it before. They divide their site up into 6 main categories, and each one is very clearly labeled. The section I use the most is “Messages”. I like this particular page the most because of its layout. It’s an easy way to use their chat functionality with people who aren’t always logged into chat on their phones. If I could change anything about this site, I would only change one thing. I would like to see more images around the page, not just on certain pages (such as “Friends”). I think this will help them grab that users attention.
