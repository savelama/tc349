The first is called Firebug, which allows you to inspect and modify HTML/CSS in real-time. This add-on also proves useful for catching errors on pages. The second add-on is called the Web Developer Toolbar. I haven’t used this much previously, but I find it useful for testing forms on pages, and as an alternate way to view behind-the-scenes information on pages.
