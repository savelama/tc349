                        Matthew is currently employed as a student web administrator for the <a href="http://www.isp.msu.edu/">Office of International Studies and Programs</a> at Michigan State University. He works individually and with teams to create, edit, and maintain various webpages for the department. These webpages usually use a combination of HTML, PHP, and jQuery. Since he began working there in April 2012, he has had the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of working with MVC frameworks (mainly the Zend framework, which is PHP-based).

                    <p>
                        Matthew does not already have a job lined up for post-graduation, but he will be attending the <a href="http://careernetwork.msu.edu/career-fairs/career-gallery/">Career Gallery 2012</a> on October 3-4. This is Michigan State University's largest career fair. There will be over 250 employers attending. Looking into more detail about the employers that will be there, he found that there are about 170 employers that are targeting computer science students. Of these 170 employers targeting computer science students, there are around 115 paid internships and 165 different full-time positions being offered.
