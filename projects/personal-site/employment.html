        <h2>Current</h2>
        <p>
            Matthew is currently employed as a student web administrator for the <a href="http://www.isp.msu.edu/">Office of International Studies and Programs</a> at Michigan State University. He works individually and with teams to create, edit, and maintain various webpages for the department. These webpages usually use a combination of HTML, PHP, and jQuery. Since he began working there in April 2012, he has had the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of working with MVC frameworks (mainly the Zend framework, which is PHP-based).
