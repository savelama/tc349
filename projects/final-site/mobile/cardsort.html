                <h3>What is Card Sorting?</h3>
                <p>
                    Card sorting is a technique that many information architects (and related professionals.) use as an input to the structure of a site or product. It's a quick, inexpensive, and reliable method, which serves as input into your information design process. Card sorting generates an overall structure for your information, as well as suggestions for navigation, menus, and possible taxonomies.

                <h3>Initial Cards</h3>
                <p>
                    My current idea for the final project website is to create a site about myself that I could possibly eventually put on my resume for potential employers to view. It would contain things like information about myself, any relevant classes that I've taken, any projects worth mentioning from those classes, my resume, and a contact page. It would be useful for the page to contain a short description of each relevant class as well, so that employers would have a better idea of what experience I gained from school before an interview, and the projects would further allow them to see the quality of my work. Basing the content on this idea, here are the cards that I've developed for content on the final project website:
