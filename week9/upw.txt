       The United Pixelworkers website uses a very straightforward and simple design. The header and footer both contain the site navigation links. There are also links to their profiles on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. I also notice that they mainly use a gallery layout to showcase their items available for purchase.  The larger image blocks are reserved for featured products, making it easier to grab the user’s attention. I think the gallery layout works particularly well for online stores. The only thing that I don’t really like about their layout is that they seem to scatter their social media links, newsletter signup, and other links sporadically throughout the other content on the page.
       
       From here, I looked more into the usability of the site and how things were implemented. Once you select an item, you get sent to a page with a larger image and other information. They keep this page very short and to-the-point. One feature that I found to be unique was that you can enter your e-mail address for items that are out of stock to be alerted when more of the items are received. The link to your shopping cart is located in the top-right corner of the screen. Hovering over this “button” will display the number of items in your cart and the total cost without shipping. The actual checkout process is also very streamlined. The pages where you enter your information contain only content necessary for collecting payment information, which I thought to be a little odd because most companies try to market as much as they can to increase their sales.
