      The layout that Happy Cog uses on their main index page seems to be a very up-and-coming layout, as we’ve seen the same general design in sites that we’ve critiqued over the last few weeks. I like this design, but I think that Happy Cog could have done a better job at separating content on the page, maybe by using other background colors for different sections or a colored-bar that spans the width of the page behind section headings. They do use different color schemes for each section, but I don’t think it is very effective. Though they have a lot of information on their main page, they do a good job of using different layout techniques in each section to grasp the user’s attention (I noticed that they use a gallery layout quite a bit, but it works well for them).
 	In regard to how they actually lay their content out, I really liked that they follow the heading tag structure. The main heading (h1) on their page is at the top of the page, and reads “We are Happy Cog”. Down from there, each major subsection begins with an h2 tag with the name of that section (Work, News, Blog, etc.). Then delving into each subsection, there are images/lists/paragraph text. This makes looking at the source code of their page very easy to follow and understand. Another element of their site that I found particularly useful was the header navigation bar. They have it set up so that as you scroll down the page, you don’t lose the navigation bar. This makes it easy to traverse content on the page without having to scroll all the way back to the top each time you want to find a new section. When I think about the structure of the page, and how it’s all laid out into a single page with anchors, I think that’s an attempt to appeal to users that might not be the best at navigating the ins-and-outs of various web pages.
