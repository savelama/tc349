I chose to use a single column layout for my personal site. I prefer this layout of the three that we covered this week because I think that it suits the material on my site the best. If I were to ever add a blog section or a photo gallery section, then I would be more inclined to use a gallery layout. If I were to move my navigation to a vertical sidebar instead of horizontally in the header, then I would move towards a two-column layout.
