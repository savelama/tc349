	On my first visit to the MSU Mobile Site, I thought it much more simplified than I thought it would be. I was expecting there to be some form of text-based content at the head of the content block. From here, I focused more on the layout and design of the website. I liked how the search bar was directly below the page header and spanned the width of the page. Each icon on the index page was straight to the point, and informed the user exactly what they were looking into.  The only thing I wasn’t particularly a fan of was the color scheme. The MSU green looked nice, but I didn’t like the grey background with the grey icon text. This page is a very easy one to navigate, which is a huge plus because it shows they are keeping up with the rising trend of mobile technology.

	 Every option on the index page led to yet another very simple page. These pages seemed to look very similar to the pages that we created in the assignment this week with the Ratchet framework. Looking at the page in the context of the underlying code, I think these pages are optimally created and laid out in order to give the mobile user the best experience possible, including very short load times. The subpages looked very similar to the sample site that I created using Ratchet. I would have liked to see more images on the page, but I can understand why the use of images and other media was sparse.
