        <h1>Website Critique (panic.com)</h1>
        <p>
            Upon first visit of the website <a href="http://www.panic.com/">http://www.panic.com</a>, 
            I was immediately a little disappointed in the design. I think they 
            had the right idea starting out, but it was poorly executed along 
            the way. The first thing I noticed about the page was its layout.
            I really like it idea of the icons for each program they developed,
            but the icons were just too large, and all the other elements were too
            close together. I think it would have looked much better with all the
            icons smaller and in a single row. This would allow the page footer 
            to be moved up. The footer was also designed with the right intent, 
            but was not executed properly. I think that rather than one column with 
            four rows, the elements of the footer should have been split into 
            two columns with two rows each.
        </p>

            Despite the layout, the actual content on the site was written in such
            a way that it was very informative, yet people who might not be so 
            technically literate would be able to understand it. When the user 
            mouses over any icons on the index page, a short description of each 
            program is given. This proves useful for people such as myself who 
            have not visited the site or heard of their software before. If you 
            click on any of the icons, you are brought to a page that goes into 
            more detail about each program. These pages are very neatly laid out.
            They do a good job at convincing the user that their software is better
            than their competitors. Overall, if I had to rate this site on a scale
            of 1 to 10, I would give it a 7.
