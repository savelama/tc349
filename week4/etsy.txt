	I think that the Etsy website is laid out in a very simplistic manner, which makes it incredibly easy for users of any skill level to navigate. There are two main elements for navigation – the top bar, and the side bar. The horizontal top bar only contains a few options, aiming to not confuse users or make the site structure too complex. The side bar does a very good job of dividing all the items they sell into categories, and allowing the user to filter their results. I think this type of layout works well for online stores.
	The other major design element that I really liked was their choice of color scheme. The site is very easy on the eyes, but still manages to draw your attention to their sales ads and items. They don’t try to cram too much information onto a single page, or have a cluttered layout. There are few ads on the site, which I also really like. Overall, I think the site is very stream-lined and aims to have a low overhead.  Personally, I wouldn’t change a thing about the site.
