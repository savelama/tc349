    I think the MSU homepage is very well laid out. To me, it seems like there are four main parts: the navigation bar, an animation, MSU news/events, and the bottom information. All of these elements fit very neatly on the page, and don't overwhelm the user, but are still effective ways of getting information out there. The two most prominent elements are the animation and news/events. To me, it seems the purpose of these aspects are to make it clear to parents and potential applicants what it happening at the university, and how Michigan State is always encouraging students to get involved. 
    Next, we have the smaller elements -- the navigation bar and bottom information. Looking at the links available in the navigation bar, a very large portion of them are more geared towards potential students. There are a few links that are obviously intended for current students and faculty, but, again, this makes sense. The website doesn't really aim to grab current students. The bottom information currently contains a story from Spartan Sagas, and information about the 'One Book, One Community' program. Overall, I don't have any complaints about the MSU homepage, though I think they could implement more interactivity into some parts of the page.
