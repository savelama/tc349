I haven't heard of Chartbeat before reviewing the site for this assignment. As a result, I personally did not like the layout of the website. It would be more efficient to use a top navigation bar to separate content prior to signing in. This is because the index page contains too much content, and could overwhelm new and potential customers. I noticed that they do use a navigation very similar to what I would like at the top of the page -- a sort of short, simple sitemap. Despite this downfall, they do manage to require interactivity between the user and the site, which could potentially be a factor that increases their customer-base.

After reading the information contained on the site about what exactly they do, and looking at the demo they provide, I think that the site is a really good idea. It would prove especially helpful for companies wishing to see real-time data on how well their website is doing. Aside from the main page, each of the other pages detailing more information about what the site does are all very elegantly laid out. I really like the color scheme they picked -- it makes the backgrounds very easy on the eyes, while still managing to draw your attention to the parts that would help increase their profits. 

Overall, I would have to say that I rate this site about a 7 out of 10, mostly because of their interactivity. I didn't like the layout of the index page at first. However, after playing with the demo, I can see that their index page functions more like a webapp than a website. The other pages have a very elegant design, that I think do a very good job of drawing in customers. Lastly, the actual purpose and functioning of the site's app are two aspects that would make Chartbeat very successful.
