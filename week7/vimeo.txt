Vimeo is a video-sharing website very popular among indie filmmakers. It seems to be very much like YouTube, except that Vimeo places the emphasis on the videos rather than advertising. This was immediately noticeable when I first visited the index page.  I’ve used Vimeo very briefly in the past to upload a video to embed on a website. The process of creating an account and uploading videos was a very simple and painless one.

Last week in class we learned about some basic ‘template’ layouts that are popular among websites – single column, two column, and gallery. It seems that Vimeo doesn’t stick to using just one layout. It looks like they went with using a combination of the single column and gallery layouts. Overall, I’d say this choice works well for them because the single column aspects allow them to place almost all of the focus for a section on the video or another single form of content, and the sections using the gallery layout are a nice way to de-clutter the page while providing tons of information.

Functionally, I like their video player much better than the YouTube-style player. It seems that Vimeo prides themselves on being able to support high-definition playback, as that was the default option on all the videos that I viewed. I like how the player isn’t cluttered with pop-ups or tons of buttons that made it challenging to see the content when you mouse over it, but they manage to compress everything. I thought the 'Channels' and 'Staff Picks' were pretty neat. I browsed through them a bit, and ended up finding quite a few videos that I liked.
